# FYI Personal Website

This very website you're looking at! Built with modern web technologies to
showcase my work and share my thoughts.

## Features

- **Static Site Generation** - Built with Astro for optimal performance
- **Content Management** - Markdown-based articles and projects
- **Notion Integration** - Dynamic content from Notion database
- **Dark Mode** - Automatic theme switching based on system preference
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

## Technical Highlights

The site uses Astro's island architecture to deliver a fast, lightweight
experience while maintaining interactive features where needed.

Key technologies:

- Astro for static site generation
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Notion API for dynamic content
- Markdown/MDX for content authoring

## What I Learned

Building this site taught me the value of choosing the right tool for the job.
Astro's approach to shipping minimal JavaScript while maintaining developer
experience is exactly what modern web development needs.
