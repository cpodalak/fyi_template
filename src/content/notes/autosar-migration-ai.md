# AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform Migration Strategy

## Background

After 8+ years working with AUTOSAR Classic Platform, migrating to Adaptive
Platform presented unique challenges. Here's how I leveraged modern AI tools to
accelerate the process while maintaining safety standards.

## Key Insights

### Traditional Approach vs AI-Assisted

- **Manual migration**: 2-3 weeks per software component
- **AI-assisted**: 3-5 days per component with better documentation

### Prompt Engineering for AUTOSAR

```
Generate AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform manifest for this Classic Platform SWC:
- Maintain original interfaces
- Add error handling for network communication
- Include deployment constraints for safety requirements
- Generate corresponding C++ implementation stubs
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI excels at boilerplate generation** but domain expertise is crucial for
   architecture decisions
2. **Prompt templates** can encode 8+ years of AUTOSAR knowledge into reusable
   workflows
3. **Validation is key** - AI suggestions must be verified against safety
   standards

## Modern Workflow

1. Use AI to generate component structure
2. Apply domain expertise for safety-critical decisions
3. Leverage automated testing for regression prevention
4. Document decisions for future reference

This hybrid approach combines deep domain knowledge with modern productivity
tools.
